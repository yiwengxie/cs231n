    "When training a model, we define a loss function which measures our current unhappiness with the model's performance; we then use backpropagation to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters, and perform gradient descent on the model parameters to minimize the loss.\n",

    "Here we will do something slightly different. We will start from a convolutional neural network model which has been pretrained to perform image classification on the ImageNet dataset. We will use this model to define a loss function which quantifies our current unhappiness with our image, then use backpropagation to compute the gradient of this loss with respect to the pixels of the image. We will then keep the model fixed, and perform gradient descent *on the image* to synthesize a new image which minimizes the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will explore three techniques for image generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Saliency Maps**: Saliency maps are a quick way to tell which part of the image influenced the classification decision made by the network.\n",
    "2. **Fooling Images**: We can perturb an input image so that it appears the same to humans, but will be misclassified by the pretrained network.\n",
    "3. **Class Visualization**: We can synthesize an image to maximize the classification score of a particular class; this can give us some sense of what the network is looking for when it classifies images of that class.\n",

To compute it, we compute the gradient of the unnormalized score corresponding to the correct class (which is a scalar) with respect to the pixels of the image. If the image has shape `(3, H, W)` then this gradient will also have shape `(3, H, W)`; for each pixel in the image, this gradient tells us the amount by which the classification score will change if the pixel changes by a small amount.
